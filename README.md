**Using AI to Detect Credit Card Fraud:**

**Project Description:**
Our objective was to create a predictive model utilizing a provided dataset. It should be able to discern fraudulent transactions based on variables such as transaction amount, card number, etc.

This is a collaborative project completed in the Western Datathon 2024. 

**Technologies Used:**

Languages used: Python

Libraries used: 
- We used scikit libraries for machine learning & data modelling.
- We used pandas & numpy for data visualization, which was used in our powerpoint.

Machine Learning Model: We found the random forest model to be the most effective, in comparison to a logistic regression model & decision tree regression model.
